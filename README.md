# How To Use the App

## Login/Sign Up  
The login and sign-up screen allows users to create a new account or log in to an existing one. During the account creation process, users can select their favorite music genres to personalize their experience. Once logged in, users are redirected to the feed screen, where they can start exploring and interacting with posts.

## Feed Screen  
The feed screen is the central space for browsing music-centric posts. Users can scroll through posts featuring videos with audio tracks, view details about who posted the content, and interact by liking or commenting on posts. This screen provides a dynamic and engaging way for users to discover and enjoy content shared by the community.

## Profile Screen  
The profile screen is where users can view and manage their activity within the app. It displays their uploaded posts, including song titles, comments, and audio links. Users can also see their number of followers and following, providing an overview of their social interactions. Additionally, users can manage their profile and posts from this screen, ensuring their content stays organized and up-to-date.

## Post Button  
The post button allows users to contribute to the community by uploading new content. When creating a post, users can add a song title, write a comment, and provide an audio link to the content they are sharing. This feature enables users to actively engage with the app and share their favorite music or original creations.

## Search Screen  
The search screen is designed to help users discover content and connect with others in the community. Users can search for specific accounts by name or handle and filter results based on genres or other criteria. This screen enhances the appâ€™s usability by simplifying the process of finding and exploring new users and content.

## Recommendation Algorithm  
The recommendation algorithm is a core feature of the app that personalizes the user experience. It curates posts based on the userâ€™s selected genres during signup and interactions within the app. Additionally, it considers content shared by the userâ€™s followers to ensure recommendations are relevant and engaging. This feature helps users discover new music and posts that align with their tastes and social connections.
